Memory game built in JavaScript (jQuery).
The end goal is to flip and match all the faced-down cards in the least possible amount of moves.

You can enter your username and choose one out of three levels (each with different amount of maximum moves).
As you play, the moves are counted. When you run out of moves, you can see whether you won or lost, and a chart with all the winners, including username, level and the amount moves it took them to win (stored in local storage)
